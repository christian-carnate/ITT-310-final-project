# About

This repository contains the "Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?" C program that I completed for the final project of my ITT-310 course as a student at Grand Canyon University. The course served as an introduction to C programming.

# Starting the Game

The full name verification prior to starting the game was required by my instructor. **Enter _Christian Carnate_ to start the game.**

# Disclaimer

This C program was created for an **_open-ended_** assignment in which all students had freedom over what to build and how to build their C program. Thus, all code in this C program is entirely original and made by me. I am **_not_** responsible for the misuse of my code for the purposes of violating academic integrity policies at any educational institution.
